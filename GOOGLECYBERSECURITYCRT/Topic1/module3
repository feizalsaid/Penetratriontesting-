CIA triad
confidentiality 
integerity 
availability 


ASSET-- a value deemed to have valuable data



NIST CSF--

NIST RME 


CIP --critical infrastructure protection

INTERNATIONAL STANDPOINT ON COUNTER ATTACKS
________________________________________
Counter attacks can only be done if:
	if it will only affect the attacking party only
	if its direct communication asking the attacker to stop 
	if it doesn't escalate the situation 
	if the counter attacks can be reversed 
	
mostly it's never easy to determine the above conditions with certainty
