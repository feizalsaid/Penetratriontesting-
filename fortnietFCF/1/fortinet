COMMON METHODS
IPsec VPN
SSL VPN
ZTNA


VPN ---- CLIENT
				SERVER 	
				PROTOCOLS

VPNS can either be ---
          site-site
	        or secure remote access

MAIN DIFF betwen vpn and ztna is the enhanced security in ztna

_______________________

SSL VPN
Allows encrypted sesion between two computing devices 
Encryption is done on L4 --transport layer
Ensures privacy ,integrity, authentication,anti-eplay(by adding a message authentication code)



SSL tunnel 
	LIKE thm 
ip address assigned is just for that sesion 

supports greater nmber of protocols thus greater access to resources
LIMITATIONS __
(SSL VPN)
other apps on client cant send data to server  


restricts network resources accessed  




IPSEC VPN
L3 encapsulation 
MODES- tunnel (more of the data packets is encapsulated)
				transport 

Authentication Header --(AH) ensures integrity , origin authenticity and protection from replay attacks 
Encapsulation Security Protocol --(ESP) ensures that data remains private from end to end

1.KEY EXCHANGE
	A.Security Association-client and server agree on  
	     crytpographic algorithms
			IPsec mode
			Network parameters
 B.Mutual Authenticaction 
 C.Shared session key thru IEK internet key exchange

2.DATA ASSEMBLY 
3.AUTHENTICATION
4.ENCRYPTION (unless transport mode is used)
5.TRANSMISSION,DECRYPTION, VERIFICTION 
USES __UDP -- to allow ipsec packets to get through firewalls
