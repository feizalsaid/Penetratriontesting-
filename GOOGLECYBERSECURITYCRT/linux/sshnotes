####learning about ssh in depth 
###I'll be using my kali machine as a client and my localohost as the server 
to reduce typing username hostname  add a config file
inside  th config file write this
	host <nameof server> ## an alias for that server  that you'll be using 
		hostname <IP>
		port <port number>
		user <username>
ONLY THING YOU"LL BE PROMPTED FOR IS THE PASSWORD
YOU CAN SET UP SEVERAL SERVERS 


CONFIG FILE --- entries for several serveral servers 


###############SSh KEYS ######
disabling password authentication
generate keys 
passphrase  is very important  --when using the  keys

copying id_rsa.pub to an authorized_keys  -- if the  keys ahd a passphrase  it's the only thing that'll be prompted  -- that's the  hard way
##easy way 
ssh-copy-id  -- copy pastes  public keys  into remote servers


###safer and shorter than default rsa
###ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "acme" -- -C comments




####sssh-agent 

caches the password once for all times
adds the key to memory 
here you actually cache the private key 

eval '$(ssh-agent)'
ssh-add <private key>
ssh user


you won't have to enter the passwd again unless you close the terminal 
ssh-agent runs  in background  in linuxdesktop agents

/etc/ssh/sshd_config -- change passwordauthentication to no and change the default port from 22
