VIRTUAL MACHINES RISKS
scalability , availability and elasticity 
//////////
securing virtual environments
/////////
- patch the OS
-Access management with strong  password policies 
-install virtual firewalls 
-implement cloud network segmentation 


Limit connectivity btn host and VM 
Remove unneccessary virtual he=rdware
Avoid virtualization sprawl  by implementing sound  management  planning 

restrict access to the hypervisor 



data remnants -- overwritting 
				degaussing--rearranging magnetic  fields on a hard drive
			
				crypto -erasing --removing existing encryption key replacing it with a new one thus data encrypted with the previous is renderred unrecoverrable
				
				shredding --mechanical phyysical destruction 



______________________
COMMON CLOUD THREATS
______________________
Authentication and authorization  -ensure modern auth models and  PoLP 
VM Creep -- frequent auditing of cloud-based machines and data 
Misconfigure storage -- robust  securing and cntaining the containers
Data  Loss --- 

Connectivity --- encrypt and secure data being transferred 
Improper logging and monitoring -- centralizing data into a SIEM  
Rights and Data Ownership -- ownership and local laws 
Cloud native protection / cloud native application protection 

xy

restrict cross site access --allow cors (cross origin resource sharing )
Logs are key 
Authority as a service 
CASB(cloud security access broker) 

REST API-- quick conf and simple monitoring 
SOAP -- xml schema post request ---legacy aps 
API work against a predefined api schema
