EC2 -- elastic compute cloud '
multitenacy -- sharing underlying  hardware resources  between VMs

vertical scaling -- increasing or decreasing allocated things

CaaS -- compute as a service  

EC2 offers different instance families :
	general purpose -- balanced resources -- web resources
	computer optimized -- compute intense tasks games 
						-- apps that benefit from high performance processors
						
	memory optimized -- fast performance for workloads that process large datasets
	
	accelerated computin-- utilize hardware accelerations
	storage optimiized -- high performance for  locally stored data 
						-- workloads  that require  high , sequential read and write access  to large datasets  on local machines
						data  warehousing apps
						high frequency online transactions  processing 
						-- offers ,000's of  low latency  random  IOPS --input output per sec

on-demand -- literally on demand
