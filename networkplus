#day one of nine (2/9)of network plus 
CSMA/CA -- a node sends a signal that it wants to transmit ((ideally 
CSMA/CD -- carrier sense multiple access collision detection 
nodes checked to see if the cable was in use 
if it was  -- the node would wait a couple of milliseconds and retransmit
if not it would just transmit

if two nodes transmitted at the same time  -- theey would sense the collision and stop transmitting and generate random numbers ((to wait  in order to transmit 
))  the one with the smallest number would transmit first 

the bigger the network the bigger the collision domain the slower the network 
thats in when using hubs

in switches each port is it's own collision domain 
SWITCH >>> BROADCAST DOMAIN 

#CONNECTING SWITCHES 
UPLINK PORTS --->when connecting two switches with a stri=aight through cable 
mostly in old switches  newer switches use auto-sense auto-medium-dependent interface crossover MDI-X

###STP SPANNING TREE PROTOCOL 
Adopted due to bridging /switching loops  -- where  a aframe would be caught a loop never reaching it's destination 
STP uses  BPDUs -- bridge protocol data units --where switches  communicate  with other switches to prevent loops from happeninng 


Configuration BPDUs  establish the topology where one switch is elected root bridge  and acts as the centre of the STP set up 
each switch then uses th root brige as a reference point to maintain a loop free topology 
There would be   redundant links for fault tolerance  that would ordinarily cause  a switching loop  but certain ports would be in 'blocking ' state  and wouldn't send or receive  frames 
the blocking state ports   would still hear the BPDUs  sourced from the root bridge  and forwaded downstream @ 2 seconds 

if a link goes down STP sends a Topology-Change-Notification BPDU -- that enables the switches  to rework themselves  around the failed device 
Ports  in 'BLOCKING' state would realize they're needed and eventually move  to a 'FORWARDING' state
Switch port connected directly to a PC should never participate in STP and could be configured with a PORTFAST setting that enables the interface to come up right away without the latency introduced by the STP and prevent TCN BPDUs from being sent  out of that switch every time the PC is powered on and off

BPDU guard -- moves  a  port configured with PortFast  into an errdisable state (( ERROR OCCURED ,DiSABLED)) ,, if  a BPDU is recieved  in that port 
Ports with PortFast  must never  recieve BPDUs because theyll cause switching loops 


ROOT GUARD -- will move a port   into  root-inconsistent  state  if BPDUs from a certain direction indicate  another switch is trying to become a root-bridge 
The root-inconsistent port will automatically return to it's forwading  state once these BPDUs stop 
this helps define  areas where root bridge should never be located

STP takes 50 seconds  to come back up and RSTP takes 6 seconds Rapid-spanning-tree-protocol
