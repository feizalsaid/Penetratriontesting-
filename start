AS i start my pentest plus journey I'm obliged to record my progress each day .

noting that i have no experience in cybersecurity as of now the amount of work i have to put in is obviously immense .

2 hours in the mornin and 2 at night eaceh and every day until the exam 

The resources i have as of now are books from OceanPDF of both Pentest plus and Jasons Udemy course Thm and HTB remain unsure as of now but maybe In shaa Allah

My biggest issue may be arrogance since I have familiarity with a lot of tools but I have to handle each and every tool as if its new to me just like I did to Tmux 

I have been putting this off for far too long now it's now time
